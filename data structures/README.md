## binSearch.cpp

n - number of elems in array\
next n elems - elems of array\
k - number of queries\
next k elems - elems to find\
print if elem is in array(0 or 1), lowerBound and upperBound\

## isBinHeap.cpp

n - num of elems
next n elem s - heap\
check if binary heap is correct(value of child >= value of current elem)\

## binHeap.cpp

n - num of elems\
find height of each tree in binomial heap\

# sumArray.cpp

arr - array
You can add number to arr[i] and count sum of array from i to j position with the help of tree\
It is very fast, it's complexity is around O(1)
